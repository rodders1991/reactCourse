# React Course

This repository is the base of my work for the react course I'm doing (https://www.udemy.com/react-2nd-edition/learn/v4/overview). The course is split up into 3 projects within the 3 folders in this directory. Please follow the README's for installation and deployment instructions.

## Project 1 - Indecision App

A simple todo list application implemented by React. This uses react components to construct the todo list and efficently pass the data through the application.

### Learnings

*JSX:*
- JSX is a very useful template langauge to construct react features. You can create html structures and pass in javascript variables which makes it very useful for react.

*React Components*:

- React components is a very efficent and reliable way to create encapsulated UI components which can manage there own state, manage others and but also only react with the part of the dom it requires. Reacts virtual dom makes this hugely performance efficient.

*Stateless functional components:* 
 - Components that don't require data to be mutated by itself, stateless functional components can be adopted. This reduces the chance of errors when changing state, cuts down on code and readability. 
 
 *Webpack:*
 - Webpack is a module bundler that allows you to create a structured codebase and bundle all the required code to run a development or production environment.
